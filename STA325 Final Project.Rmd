## Data

### Drug poisoning dataset
```{r}
death0 <- read.csv("data/Drug_Poisoning_Mortality_by_County.csv", header = TRUE)

# est_death_rate is age adjusted death rate, deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000

# data cleaning
death0 <- death0 %>%
  rename(est_death_rate = Estimated.Age.adjusted.Death.Rate..16.Categories..in.ranges.)

death <- death0 %>%
  mutate(
    est_death_rate1 = case_when(
      est_death_rate == "30+" ~ "30-30", #can we do this?
      TRUE ~ as.character(est_death_rate))) %>%

# recreate new variables
death1 <- death %>%
  group_by(COUNTY) %>%
  summarise(avg_death_rate = mean(death_rate), # average death rate during 2006-2012
            avg_pop = mean(pop_num))
```

### Arcos dataset
```{r}
# arcos0 <- read.csv("data/arcos-wv-statewide-itemizedexcel.csv", header = TRUE)
# 
# # create subset with less variables

# write.csv(arcos_subset, "data/arcos_subset.csv")

arcos_subset = read.csv("data/arcos_subset.csv")
```

### Income dataset
```{r}
# income data -- is this adjusted for inflation? also only goes from 2011 to 2016.
wv_income_data = read.csv("data/wv_median_household_income_data.csv") %>%
  filter(county != "West Virginia") %>%
  mutate(county = str_to_upper(county)) %>%
  group_by(county) %>%
  summarize(average_median_income = mean(median_income))
```

### Merge datasets
```{r}
# merge arcos_subset and death1
arcos_death_wv_all <- merge(arcos_subset, death1, by.x = "BUYER_COUNTY", by.y = "COUNTY", all.x = TRUE)

# merge income with arcos and death data
wv_all = merge(arcos_death_wv_all, wv_income_data, by.x = "BUYER_COUNTY", by.y = "county", all.x = TRUE)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
# summary(death0)
# summary(death)
# summary(death1)
# 
# head(arcos0)
# head(arcos_subset)
# summary(arcos_subset)

# total active weight by county and drug name
arcos2 <- arcos_subset %>%
  group_by(BUYER_COUNTY,DRUG_NAME) %>%
  summarise(all_active_wt = sum(TOTAL_ACTIVE_WT))
head(arcos2)

# calculate total active weight in each county from 2006-2012
all_act_wt <- arcos_subset %>%
  group_by(BUYER_COUNTY) %>%
  summarise(all_active_wt = sum(TOTAL_ACTIVE_WT))
head(all_act_wt)

# plot of active weight per person vs. average death rate
# merge all_act_wt with death_avg
all_act_wt_death <- merge(all_act_wt, death1, by.x = "BUYER_COUNTY", by.y = "COUNTY") %>%
  mutate(act_wt_person = all_active_wt/avg_pop)
head(all_act_wt_death)

ggplot(data = all_act_wt_death) +
  geom_point(aes(x = act_wt_person, y = avg_death_rate)) +
  labs(x = "Total Active Weight of Drug Per Person 2006-2012",
       y = "Total Overdose Death Rate in a County 2006-2012")
```

Relationship between number of manufacturers/distributors shipping to a county vs opioid deaths by county
```{r}
wv_all %>%

  summarise(number_of_reporters = n()) %>%
  group_by(BUYER_COUNTY, avg_death_rate) %>%
  summarise(number_of_reporters_for_given_county = sum(number_of_reporters)) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = avg_death_rate, y = number_of_reporters_for_given_county)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Average death rate of a county", y = "Number of manufacturers involved",
       title = "Relationship between number of manufacturers and death rates in a county?")
